# Web3 Learning dApp

**Educational Web3 application built with React and Ethereum**

## Purpose
This project teaches Web3 development by building a real decentralized application. Every concept is explained, every decision is documented.

## What You'll Learn
- How to connect a MetaMask wallet
- How to interact with the Ethereum blockchain
- How to send ETH transactions
- How to read/write smart contract data
- How gas fees work
